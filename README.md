Hi, I’m <b> Gael Estrera </b>! I'm currently a 3 <b> BS Management Information Systems </b> with a specialization in <b> Enterprise Systems </b>. <br><br>

As an Information Systems student, we are currently being taught how to design data models, data diagrams, database designs, as well as the technical development skills for implementing and deploying applications. All of these are being taught while taking into consideration business logic. I found myself being more inclined to the development-side of Information Systems such as applications development, software development, database design, and web application development. <Br>

Through Enterprise Systems, I'm able to learn electives that emphasize on Enterprise-level Information Systems planning, Software Engineering topics and applications, Network Security and Cryptography, and Enterprise Systems programming by the end of my college curriculum. I'm an aspiring <b> Software Developer </b> that is very passionate in programming and developing applications that create positive impact for certain business/enterprise needs. <br><br>


  
I'm knowledgeable in Python, Java, Javascript, and MySQL. <br><br>
